- More paradigms
- Automatically updated paradigm list in menu
    - Requires passing paradigm-dict to ALL views
- Display paradigms

- Redo color scheme - make dict shared across application
- Ensure privacy settings are respected across application
- Clear out old code, revamp URLs
- Add instructions
- Switch between transliteration types


#Trivial to implement, more time required:
- Multilanguage support
    - Requires database migration
    - All forms probably need to change
